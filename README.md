# BBM412-FinalProject  -  THE PROTECTOR


The Protector is a forest simulation about the life of a protector living in the forest. The subject of the simulation shows how industrial wastes affect forests and animals. So, the protector has tasks such as treating the animals affected by these wastes, cleaning the areas affected by the wastes, and trying to ensure the continuity of the population by planting new plants. As all these tasks are completed, it is aimed to show a positive change in animals and the environment.

# Bellman–Held–Karp algorithm

In this simulation, the route that the protector will create is very important, because the protector's job is to save the most animals and clean the most places in the shortest time. We are planning to handle this problem as the traveling salesman problem and solve it with the Bellman–Held–Karp algorithm.

# Plants

Every healed animal and every seed planted gives you points.
